# Folder to manage the GWA 3D Front dataset and the 3D-FRONT dataset

Please add the 3D-FRONT, 3D-FUTURE-model and GWA_Dataset_small folders to this directory.

GWA_Dataset_small link is available from the  [GWA Repository](https://github.com/GAMMA-UMD/GWA/tree/master/download), or [directly here](https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/gamma-datasets/GWA_Dataset_small.zip).

The 3D-FRONT and 3D-FUTURE-model are slightly difficult to get access to. [Please apply here](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/65347). You should get access within a week.

Expected folder structure:

```text

    .
    ├── ...
    ├── 3D-FRONT
    ├── 3D-FUTURE-model
    ├── GWA_Dataset_small
    ├── preprocessed_obj_meshes                   # Generated by 'preprocess_3Dfront.py'. Contains preprocessed 3D-FRONT models in .obj format.

```

Then, run the following script while here:

```bash

python preprocess_3D_front.py

```

Congrats, the datasets should be ready.
You can now proceed to the 'RIR-in-a-Box/models' folder for extra instructions.

## How the csv subset were created

The gwa_3Dfront.csv was created using the format_csv.py script.

```bash

cd preprocessing
python format_csv.py

```

The training and validation subsets were sliced manually from gwa_3Dfront.csv.

Other csv files were created using create_1m_and_dp_csvs.py

```bash

cd preprocessing
python create_1m_and_dp_csvs.py

```
