# Folder to manage the GWA 3D Front dataset and the 3D-FRONT dataset

Please add the 3D-FRONT, 3D-FUTURE-model and GWA_Dataset_small folders to this directory.

GWA_Dataset_small link is available from the  [GWA Repository](https://github.com/GAMMA-UMD/GWA/tree/master/download), or [directly here](https://obj.umiacs.umd.edu/gamma-datasets/GWA_Dataset_small.zip).

If you are specifically members of my team, feel free ask me for the much smaller preprocessed 3D-FRONT datasets, I'll put them on google drive for you guys.

Expected folder structure:

```text

    .
    ├── ...
    ├── 3D-FRONT
    ├── 3D-FUTURE-model
    ├── GWA_Dataset_small
    ├── preprocessed_obj_meshes                   # Generated by 'preprocess_3Dfront.py'. Contains preprocessed 3D-FRONT models in .obj format.

```

Then, run the following script while here:

```bash

python preprocess_3D_front.py

```

Congrats, the datasets should be ready.
You can now proceed to the 'RIR-in-a-Box/models' folder for extra instructions.

## If the the csv file isn't right

If the gwa_3Dfront.csv file isn't right, please go into the preprocessing folder and run the following script:

```bash

python format_csv.py

```
