# RIR-in-a-Box Validation Dataset

This is to be the validation dataset for RIR-in-a-Box.
It contains 55 audio recordings of 10 ESS each.
It also contains 30 room meshes recorded on the HoloLens of 1 room configuration with 3 different recording methods.
I'll ask Diego/Arie/Fujita to record extra room meshes for the other room configuration.
