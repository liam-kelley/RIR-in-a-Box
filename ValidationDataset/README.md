# RIR-in-a-Box Validation Dataset

This is to be the validation dataset for RIR-in-a-Box.
It contains 55 audio recordings of 10 ESS each.
It also contains 30 room meshes recorded on the HoloLens of 1 (**TODO** : 2) room configuration(s) with 3 different recording methods.

## Information

### Dataset creation

- I obtained mesh data from the HoloLens using the device portal. As you scan the room longer, the data becomes more precise, so I made sure to record the mesh multiple times to account for the amount of time spent scanning. So far I only recorded the confroom open configuration, so **TODO** record the confroom closed configuration. **TODO** add the mesh names into 'validation_dataset.csv'. (Right now they're only implemented as booleans).
- I manually measured mic and src positions in the office and wrote them down in 'validation_dataset.csv'. (see my notes room_geometry/manually_measured/).
- I used 'ESS_play.ipynb' to play/save the ESS on my PC.
- I recorded the ESS using the HoloLens and saved the recordings in 'audio_recordings/'. **TODO** add the audio filepaths into 'validation_dataset.csv'.
- I used 'deconvolve_audio_recs.py' to deconvolve the audio recordings into 'deconvolved_audio_recs/'.
- I then used 'slice_10xrirs.py' to get 10 rirs from the deconvolved audio recordings.

### Other scripts

- 'get_sweep.py' provides a utility to get an ESS, an inverse filter, the ESS length and the sampling rate used for the ESS.
- 'visualize_10xrirs.ipynb' was used to identify the correct 'find_peaks' properties. (OUTDATED)

### Simplified summary of validation configurations

This totals up to 481 usable configurations.
**TODO** For every mesh Diego/Arie/Fuijta :'\) records with the confroom closed, we'll add 35 configurations.
**TODO**  For every mesh Diego/Arie/Fuijta :'\) records with the confroom open, we'll add 42 configurations.
