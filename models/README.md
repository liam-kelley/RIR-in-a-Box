# Models

This folder contains the scripts defining the RIR-in-a-Box models (RIRBox1, RIRBox2), along with the script defining the mesh2ir model.
This folder also contains utility functions for loading models, and simple methods for inference.

Example scripts for uses can be found in main/train/train_gwa.py for training and in main/inference.py for inference.

## Setup Instructions

If you want to try out the models from MESH2IR alongside the models from RIR-in-a-Box, please add the MESH2IR models in their "MESH2IR", "MESH2IR-D-EDR" folders to this directory.

Download links are available from the MESH2IR repository, or [directly here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1poy8LRN9Wakz-rGhatdL20Hv3FGKHSD4).

Congrats! If you followed the instructions in 'RIR-in-a-Box/README.md' and 'RIR-in-a-Box/datasets/GWA_3DFRONT/README.md', then repository setup is complete!
You can now proceed to the usage instructions in 'RIR-in-a-Box/README.md'.
